doji ([jap.][doji], "どうじ", _the same event_) is a video synchronizing
utility, allowing it's users to watch the same video at the same time,
desipte not being in the same place.

# Technical Info

Instead of directly connecting the user to thrid-party sites, doji uses
[youtube-dl][yt-dl] to first download the
video onto the server, then host it directly to it's users.

Besides protecting the user from potentially dangerous actors,
youtube-dl provides a wide range of [supported sites][yt-dl-sites],
which are all also accesible to doji users. No third-party vendor is
needed to run doji.

## Building

To build doji, the [Go][golang] toolchain has to be installed on ones
device, as well as [go-bindata][bindata]. Then running

	go generate
	go build

should suffice to have a functioning `doji` binary.

## Running

By default, executing `doji` can be done anywhere, since all
dependencies and assets are statically compiled into the binary.

The following environmental variables influence doji's behavior:

- `LISTEN`: how to listen for HTTP requests (default: `localhost:8080`,
  alternatives: `:80`, `192.168.100:400`)
- `SETDIR`: where to look for sets (see _Sets_) (default: nothing)
- `DEBUG`: if any value prevent log from being sent to a
  `/tmp/doji/doji.log.gz` and instead print directly to stdout.

## Sets

If `SETDIR` is to be used, it has to point to a directory, containing
further directories, which in turn contain video files. For example:

	./sets/
	./sets/linear-algebra/
	./sets/linear-algebra/001-vectors.webm
	./sets/linear-algebra/002-linear-combin.webm
	./sets/linear-algebra/003-linear-transf.webm
	./sets/linear-algebra/004-matrix.webm
	./sets/linear-algebra/005-three-dimension.webm
	./sets/cosmos/
	./sets/cosmos/the-shores-of-the-cosmic-ocean.mp4
	./sets/cosmos/one-voice-in-the-cosmic-fugue.mp4
	./sets/cosmos/harmony-of-the-worlds.mp4
	./sets/cosmos/heaven-and-hell.mp4
	./sets/cosmos/blues-for-a-red-planet.mp4

When users in a room load a set, each file in, for example
`linear-algebra` will be symbolically linked into the rooms directory
(meaning that sets can be stored on a separate partition).
