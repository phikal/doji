	<h2>Commands</h2>
	<p>
		All commands are entered into the chat box
		(white field under the messages, in the blue
		area). doji recognizes a command when it's
		prefixed with a forwards slash (<code>/</code>),
		and interprets all the following words, delemitered
		by one or more whitespaces as it's arguments.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most <q>more complex</q> interaction with doji is done
		using these commands, but most users can comfortably use
		it without any knowledge about these.
	</p>
	<p>
		For everyday options, use the settings tab (right next to
		this one). Note that everything that can be done there, can
		also be achieved using commands.
